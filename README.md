# MAC0216 - Programming Techniques I

Repository for the USP course 'MAC0216 - Programming Techniques I', taken during the second semester of 2023.
Professor: Daniel Batista

Program:
Basic concepts of computer architecture. Assembly language and assemblers, object file linking, interface with hardware and high-level languages. Interaction with the operating system at the Shell level: streams, standard input and output, redirection and pipes. Shell scripts. Build automation of programs and libraries with tools like "make". Code modularization. Linking, static and dynamic libraries. Construction of libraries. Debugging and testing techniques. Version control techniques and tools. Building a system in a procedural language (for example, C). Study of a dynamic scripting language (for example, Python or Ruby). Introduction to Object Orientation in the context of dynamic languages.

I completed three assignments for the course: an assembly program, a chat system integrated with Telegram using Bash, and a C library that included the functions from the first program.
